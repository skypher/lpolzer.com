# VPNBox: your private one-click VPN server

In the past years, VPN services have sprouted up like mushrooms.
From free to expensive, from fancy to basic, from Japan to Turkey,
you can get anything. And that's a problem, actually. Because with
most packages, you never know what you'll get. In fact, a lot of
services have shady ties to certain governments (e.g. the PRC)
or other potentially malicious actors. After all, a person's traffic
has become a valuable commodity for advertising services and intelligence
agencies alike.

How do we solve this problem? Ideally, you would have your own VPN hardware
sitting in some data center, in a locked cage to which only you have access.
A better trade-off is renting a server and running your own. However, most
people don't have the skills to set up such a server, or the money to pay
someone else to do it. Nevertheless, wouldn't it be a considerable improvement
to everyone's privacy if they could get their own VPN server with just a click
or two, and at a price that can compete with a lot of less secure VPN services?

This is what I'm trying to do with VPNBox, a project in its early stages.
The deployment infrastructure is largely complete, and I am in the process of
creating a web site for Beta testers.
